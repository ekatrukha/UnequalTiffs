UnequalTiffs
===

<img src="https://katpyxa.info/software/UnequalTiffs_logo.png" align="right" style="padding:100px"/>This is [FIJI](https://fiji.sc/) plugin for working with a set of [.tif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF) images of different sizes, but with the same number of dimensions.  
  
The plugin can perform their concatenation to a hyperstack, making 3D/4D/5D montage, or browse them in [BigDataViewer](https://imagej.net/plugins/bdv/)/[BigVolumeViewer](https://github.com/UU-cellbiology/bvv-playground)  
 
Created hyperstacks are 'read-from-disk' and cached, so that all input tif files do have to fit in the memory.  

Check out **[wiki](https://github.com/ekatrukha/UnequalTiffs/wiki)** for the documentation.
